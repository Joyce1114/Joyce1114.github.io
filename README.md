This is the website for our app!

We will create a journaling app called Everyday that allows users to record notes with text, photos, and/or audio. The basic screens of the app will be:
1. [Login screen (if not logged in)]
2. List of journal entries with title and one line preview of content
3. View journal entry
4. Add an entry
5. Discover (public) entries by other people that the user might be interested in based on natural language processing

Our app will automatically store the location of the user when they create the note and use it to get location data like the weather. Users will be able to create different types of records, including ‘food’, ‘dream’ and ‘note,’ with different functionalities associated with each category. 
For example, the ‘food’ category will have different tags like ‘Breakfast’, ‘Lunch’, ‘Dinner’, ‘Snack’, or ‘Drink’, and might allow the user to save a rating. Users can also filter by the different types of records.
